IMPLEMENTING TLS SERVERS AND CLIENTS:
- Transport Layer Security/Secure Socket Layer (TLS/SSL) is a cryptographic protocol designed to provide secure communications on the internet
- they use X.509 certificates along with session keys to verify whether the socket server you are communicating with is the one that you want to communicate with.
- TLS uses long-term public and secret keys to exchange a short-term session key so that data can be encrypted between client and server
- TLS also provides authentication so you can ensure that the webserver you are connecting to is the one you actually think it is, thus preventing MITM attacks

To generate a private key, execute the following SSL command:
openssl genrsa -out server.pem 2048

Next, use the following command to create a certificate signing request file:
openssl req -new -key server.pem -out server.certificates

Then, to create a self-signed certificate that you can use for your own purpose or testing, use the following command:
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in server.csr -signkey server.pem -out server.create
